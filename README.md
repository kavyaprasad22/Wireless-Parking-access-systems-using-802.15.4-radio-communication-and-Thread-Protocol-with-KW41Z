# Wireless Parking access systems using 802.15.4 radio communication and Thread Protocol with KW41Z
This prototype eliminates the hazels of current magnetic stripe card based parking lot access system by achieving low power wireless transmission of user identity to the gate controller through thread based end device module in the car. User identification is done through ipv6 address.By logging details of the same to a database using MySQL, revenue collection is made easy.

Hardware Requirements:
2 KW41Z modules

Software Requirements:
Python
MySQL
ODBM
